The `paramlink` package has been superseded by the [**ped
suite**](https://magnusdv.github.io/pedsuite/). In particular, the main
features of `paramlink` can now be found in the following packages:

-   [**pedtools**](https://github.com/magnusdv/pedtools): Basic handling
    of pedigrees and marker data
-   [**paramlink2**](https://github.com/magnusdv/paramlink2): Parametric
    linkage analysis
-   [**forrel**](https://github.com/magnusdv/forrel): Forensic
    applications
-   [**ribd**](https://github.com/magnusdv/ribd): Relatedness
    coefficients and IBD triangle

Note that `paramlink` is *not* compatible with the ped suite. It is
maintained only for legacy purposes and should not be used in new
projects.
